## Generic Genetic Algo

This generic genetic algorithm can be used in a variety of fields for optimization.
It includes the basis for genetic algorithms and can also be used for constrained optimization.
In the demo, it minimizes an easy sphere function but I use it currently to optimize trading strategies (inconsistent function).
Try it on your own with other functions from [Test functions for optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_functions_for_optimization)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for demo purposes.

```
pip2 install numpy
python2 genetic_algorithm.py
```
